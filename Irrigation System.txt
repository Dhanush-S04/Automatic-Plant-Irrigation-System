Constants:
    DRY_THRESHOLD = 700
    PUMP_DURATION = 5000 (milliseconds)
    READING_INTERVAL = 60000 (milliseconds)

Pins:
    Moisture Sensor Pin = A0
    Pump Pin = 2

Setup:
    Initialize Moisture Sensor Pin as INPUT
    Initialize Pump Pin as OUTPUT

Main Loop:
    Read moisture level from Moisture Sensor Pin
    If moisture level is greater than DRY_THRESHOLD:
        Activate Pump Pin
        Wait for PUMP_DURATION
        Deactivate Pump Pin
    Wait for READING_INTERVAL
